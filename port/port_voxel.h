 * port_voxel.h — experimental 3D ("voxel") view of the room, SDL_GPU only.
 *
 * Phase 1: the bottom map layer is the ground plane, the top map layer floats
 * one tile above it, entity sprites stand up as camera-facing billboards at
 * their ground position (entity z lifts them), shadows lie flat, and HUD
 * sprites + BG0 (text boxes) draw as a flat 2D overlay. All pixels are decoded
 * on the GPU from the live VRAM / palette / OAM / room sub-tile maps, so
 * palette fades, tile animations and SetTile rewrites show up for free.
 *
 * Falls back to the normal 2D present outside room gameplay (title, menus,
 * subtasks, cutscenes that null the map layers).
